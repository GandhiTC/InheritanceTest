Basics
	- A subclass extends or inherits from a base/parent/super class
		- Subclass "is a kind of" superclass
			- Giraffe is a type of animal
	- An object instance is instantiated
		- Object instance is an object of the instantiated class' type
			- Object instance is a giraffe



The four access levels are:
	- Private   - Visible to the class only.
	- Default   - Visible to the package, the default. No modifiers are needed.
	- Protected - Visible to the package and all subclasses.
	- Public    - Visible to the world.
	


Default VS Protected:
	- Default constricts access to package ONLY
	- Protected allows accessing protected items to subclasses from other packages
	- Protected does not allow accessing protected items to classes from other packages that instantiate the class with protected items



The following rules for inherited methods are enforced:
	- Methods declared public in a superclass also must be public in all subclasses.
	- Methods declared protected in a superclass must either be protected or public in subclasses; they cannot be private.
	- Methods with no access modifier declared (default modifier) in the superclass cannot be accessed at all from a different package.
	- Methods declared private are not inherited at all.
